    *Created a work day scheduler
    *At the top of the planner the date and year is displayed.
    *Includes time blocks for standard business hours
    *Each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it has past, if it is present, or a future plan.
    *The user can click into a time block to add/update an event
    *The user can click the save button and the event is saved into local storage
    *When the user refreshes the page, the saved events persist
